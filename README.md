Installation and execution is the same as described on [Bill Kennedy's generics examples](https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/blob/master/topics/go/generics/README.md)

### Install go2go ###

```sh
# Clone the current source code for Go on disk.
cd $HOME
mkdir go2go
cd go2go
git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go goroot
cd goroot

# Fetch all the branches and checkout dev.go2go.

git checkout dev.go2go

# Change into the source directory and build.
cd src
./make.bash

# Navigate back to where you cloned the repo.
cd $GOPATH/github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/topics/go/generics

# Then source the `.env` file located in the generics folder.
# export GO2GO_DEST=$HOME/go2go/goroot
# export PATH="$GO2GO_DEST/bin:$PATH"
# export GOROOT="$GO2GO_DEST"
# export GO2PATH="$GO2GO_DEST/src/cmd/go2go/testdata/go2path"
